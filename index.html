<center><p class="large">Improving My Productivity In IT</p></center>

<center><h2 class="large2"> About Me</h2></center>

<center><p2> I have a multitude of interests that vary from Astronomy, Game Design, Software Development and Content Creation. <br>

The important thing about these interests is that I lack the knowledge, skill, hardware and software to do them well. <br>

My plan to remedy this is to get an Apprenticeship in IT Maintenance so I can learn how to build a computer and understand <br>

what its specifications are and what they can do, as well as adding longevity to the systems I use. I also want to learn various <br>

coding languages so I could potentially make small game projects as a hobby as well as have the ability to make software and websites <br>

for any friends that might need them. After finishing a 13 week course with the Prince’s Trust, they recommended a coding course <br>

from CodeNation to me based on my interests they learned on the course. After completing the 1 week course, I’m currently on a <br>

3 week coding course with CodeNation so I can lay out the groundwork for progressing down the route I want to go down. <br>

While I’d failed to achieve what I’d hoped to, in a team project I contributed to the creation of a small text-based game which I consider <br>

to be a first draft of what I think I can make in the future. I’d managed to create an introduction to the game which gives some basic context <br>

into what the player is supposed to do and gives them the option of how to progress. This is the function I used to achieve this: <br> 
<br>
#def intro(): <br>
   # print("You are aboard a government loaned ship orbiting Titan, one of Saturn's moons") <br> 

   # time.sleep(4) <br>

   # print("Your mission is to board a research station on Titan and collect hard drives of data from the station.") <br>

   # time.sleep(5) <br>

   # print("Something has happened to the researchers there.") <br>

   # time.sleep(4) <br>

   # print("You stand at a terminal where you can contact the contractor for this mission and request backup if needed") <br>

   # time.sleep(5) <br>

   # doit = input("Do you want to explore the ship or continue the mission alone? [1] [2]> ") <br>

     

    #if doit == "1": <br>

   #     explore_ship() <br>

     

  #  elif doit == "2": <br>

 #       solo_explorer() <br>

#intro() </center>

<center><p3>IT has many uses in modern business, it increases/improves productivity in multiple ways, like the ability to work <br>

from home in some instances, meaning that if for whatever reason an employee cannot come to work, like being ill or a sudden <br>

restriction to travel, their productivity would not be reduced. IT can also increase productivity in relation to the storage <br>

and handling of data, meaning instead of writing things down manually, users can store much more information on a server or hard drive <br>

than they could a physical piece of paper. This has revolutionized the way we achieve Networking and Digital Marketing, <br>

which has drastically improved productivity and thus, the economy. </p3></center>

<center><h4 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 1.2</h4></center>

<center><p4>Designing and building a Digital system requires some methodology to accomplish in the most efficient manner. <br>
    
The preferred method of creating digital systems is referred to as the System/Software Development Life Cycle, or the SDLC, and usually <br>

contains five or six steps that you must follow when working on a project. These are as follows: <br>
<br>
Requirments/Analysis - Before you begin your project you must research the requirements to complete it. This includes what the system will <br>

be used for, who it is for and additional details regarding. For example, if you were making a registration system for a hospital, <br>

you would need to understand what the problem is with the current system, what changes would be made? Is this registration system for <br>

customer appointments? Present staff?  Once you understand what the intended outcome of the project is, you need to do a feasibility study, <br>

is the project withinyour capacity to complete? Consider things like cost, deadlines, your workforce and resources like computers and software. <br>
<br>
Design – This is where you begin planning your project. Before you begin coding your website/database/program, you need to decide <br>

what it will look like in terms of User Interface (UI) and how the system will complete its intended task. To do this you can develop <br>

Pseudo code, which is the process of displaying the code you intend to use in a way that’s easy for humans to read. <br>
<br>
Implementation – Now you understand what system you’re going to make, how long it will take to do it and how you are going to do it <br>

you can begin creating the system and translating your pseudo code into the relevant code to the programming language you are using. <br>
<br>
Testing – Before you release your program to the end-user/customer you must first double check that all of the code you’ve designed <br>

works as intended and the program as a whole functions to the specifications detailed in the first stage. <br>
<br>
Deployment – After the program has been thoroughly tested for bugs you need to ensure that the program fits the user’s specifications. <br>

You can follow a process known as User Acceptance Testing, which is where the user will test the system to see if it fits the <br>

specifications they listed and provide feedback on the project before it is fully released. then you now need to plan the most <br>
effective way to deploy the system while minimising the disruption to the workflow. <br>
<br>
Maintenance – Even though the system has been completed and implemented the project is not yet officially over. This is the time <br>

for user feedback. Once they’ve had ample time to use the system in the way it was meant for they can then provide feedback on the <br>

way the system works and report bugs and shortcomings if they exist. In the event the system needs to be updated, the SDLC resets and <br>
the updates can be developed in the same way the system was developed to begin with.

<center><h4 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 1.3</h4></center> 

<center><p5>I will plan the creation of my website step by step using Trello which will guide me in completing the individual aspects <br>
    
of the website in an efficient manner. I will follow the SDLC in order to make use of the minimal time I have for the project. This will <br>
    
be the best way to avoid issues like bugs and having to constantly rearrange the contents of the webpage and thus, the code needed to make it. <br>

</p5></center>

<center><h5 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 1.4</h5></center>

<center><p6>There are many things to think about when considering the likelihood of your project succeeding. Of course much of this can be discovered <br>
   
through the Requirements Analysis stage of the SDLC, which is why not following one of the SDLC models can almost guarantee failure or at least <br>
   
costing you a lot of time and money. One thing to consider when taking a project is the workforce you have and any potential deadlines. Would your <br>
   
employees need to work overtime? Do you currently have the resources such as up-to-date hardware and software? Would getting more resources result <br>
   
in going over a potential budget. If these things aren’t considered then it poses a huge risk to the completion of the project and a business can <br>
   
easily go bankrupt if it makes any mistakes in this regard, which is why choosing and following the correct method of the SDLC is so important. <br>

</p6></center>

<center><h6 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 1.5</h6></center>

<center><p7>Before I begin the creation of my website, I need to consider the factors which affect the suitability of specific <br>
    
programming languages. Certain programming languages don’t have the same capabilities when using certain Operating Systems, and <br>

also don’t all have the same abilities when it comes to web design. This means I have to plan out what I intend to do on my website, <br>

research the capabilities of different programming languages to see if they can do what I need and also research which Operating <br>

Systems those programming languages work with in order to be sure I won’t hit an impasse during my project and have to start from scratch. <br>
<br>
<br>
</p7></center>

<center><h7 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 1.6</h7></center><br>
<br>
<center><p8>Using Trello, I was able to lay out the steps I needed to take to complete my program, this also allowed me to bounce a few ideas off of <br>

one another so that I came up with some new ideas. This helps me form a complete picture of how I want my website to turn out. Using GitHub, I can <br>
      
save versions of my website and code onto a page and comment on what changes were made and why. This allows me to maintain a path of progression by <br>
   
having my current route and thought process laid out in front of me so as to help me figure out what I need to do next. This also helps me to revert <br>
   
my program/website back to a previous state, like a backup in the event that something goes wrong and I can’t figure out to fix it.<br>
<br>
<center><h8 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 1.7</h8></center><br>
<center><p9>There are many laws regarding digital products which are meant to restrict the usage of personal data in the interest of user safety. <br>
   
The Data Protection Act is a series of laws which govern what data is allowed to be used and is intended to place responsibility on the company/business <br>

that uses that data to protect it to prevent it getting into the public. This includes but is not limited to, a user’s address, name, date of birth, and contact information. <br>

<br>

It’s important to keep these laws in mind when dealing with a program/product which collects user data (like a delivery service) as you want to protect <br>

this data and stop it from being accessed by third parties. This makes digital projects a little harder to undertake since you have to think about as many <br>

ways someone could access the data you collect as possible in order to protect it and ensure you stay with the guidelines of the DPA. <br>
</p9></center><br>

<center><h9 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 2.1</h9></center><br>
<center><p10>Currently the tools I’ve been using on this project have proven very useful and sufficient in making my website. Using Trello I’ve been able <br>
   
   to plan out exactly how to make my website and how I’m going to do, as well as gauge how much work I have left to do. Using GitHub I will be able to reduce <br>
   
   the amount of setbacks I have during my project which are caused by making mistakes in my code by having versions of my program/website backed up on my <br>
   
   GitHub page. As of right now, there’s no need for me to change my approach to the project. <br>

</p10></center><br>

<center><h10 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 2.2</h10></center><br>
<center><p11>The tools I’ve used to undertake this project have suited my tasks perfectly as I’ve been able to properly plan out the structure of the project <br>
   
   and how to complete it. Visual Studio Code can be used with many different programming language extensions which allows makes it ideal for creating this <br>
   
   website as it contains all of the necessary languages to complete the project. This includes the ability to add styles to the website and make it stand out more. <br>

</p11></center><br>

<center><h11 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 2.3</h11></center><br>
<center><p12>While there are a multitude of things I would change and improve with time to make my website more stylish, I am happy with how much I’ve done <br>
   
   compared to how much I knew how to do a few days from making it. My website is quite basic but I created what I did under a short enough amount of time <br>
   
   that I’m impressed with my progress. With more time and resources, I believe I can learn to make professional websites and can even be designed to <br>
   
   accommodate any future projects I decide to undertake. <br>

</p12></center><br>

<center><h12 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 2.4</h12></center><br>

<center><p13>Some of the things I would improve upon is to create a better background and change the text to a more suitable colour, as well as change the <br>
   
alignment of the text to make the webpage look a little more unique. Another thing I would add is dropdown buttons and hyperlinks so instead of having <br>
   
all of the content on one page, I could have multiple pages that the user could scroll through. <br>

</p13></center><br>

<center><h13 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 2.5</h13></center><br>
<center><p14>As the website did not become what I had hoped it would, it doesn’t fit the requirements that I initially set. The outcome of the project is <br>
   
less than what I had planned for it. I have had to simply align the text in the centre of a single page instead of aligning them elsewhere and creating <br>
   
unique pages with varying backgrounds.<br>

</p14></center><br>

<center><h14 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 3.1</h14></center><br>
<center><p15></p15>I may have had time to improve my website and make it look more professional had I not lost valuable time due to my own IT systems <br>
   
having problems. My productivity on this project was greatly decreased because of my computer freezing for multiple hours on end. If I were to work in a <br>

team and collaborate I it’s very likely I would be able to make a more finished product. This would be a result of having multiple people to exchange ideas <br>

with on the content of the website as well as each being able to come up with the correct syntax to create the website I originally had planned. <br>
</center><br>

<center><h15 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 3.2</h15></center><br>
<center><p16>If I had worked in a team of multiple people then it would have made researching the syntax necessary to achieving the project outcome I <br>
   
wanted much easier and quicker, improving both my productivity and efficiency. I allowed myself to get bogged down on what part of my website for too <br>

long instead of balancing my time out between all aspects to make a finished product. <br>
</p16></center><br>

<center><h16 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 3.3</h16></center><br>
<center><p17>Next time I begin one of these projects I will try to better estimate how much time is needed to complete one aspect of the project so <br>
   
when under a time constraint I have a better chance of making a finished product and can put more emphasis on maintenance after the main project has been completed. <br>
</p17></center><br>

<center><h17 class="large2">Unit 1, Outcome 3.4</h17></center><br>
<center><p18>When I attempt one of these projects again, I will challenge myself to complete it by a deadline in order to test out my solution to my <br>
problem on this project. I will spread my efforts to different aspects and functions of the website and not stay on one area for too long so as to <br>
get closer to lay out the framework for future maintenance rather than get stuck on one aspect which can limit my productivity. <br>
</p18></center><br>

<center><h18 class="large2">Unit 2, Outcome 1.1</h18></center><br>
<center><p19>The title of the website will be “Improving My Productivity In IT” and the About Me paragraph will be on the front page, below a header <br>
   
called “About Me”, with a dropdown button above and below the paragraph which will contain hyperlinks to the different pages which contain the <br>

information on the different Units and Outcomes. Each page will have its own header named after the content of their respective paragraphs and each <br>

page will contain another dropdown button. For example, there will be a header called “The SDLC” which will contain all the information I currently <br>

have pertaining to the SDLC, and both above and below this section there will be a dropdown button that can take the user to any page they request <br>

once they have finished reading. Aside from the pages about my knowledge of IT, there will also be another page which contains information about <br>

projects I am currently working on, like a Python game.<br>
</p19></center><br>

<center><h19 class="large2">Unit 2, Outcome 1.2</h19></center><br>
<center><p20>Copyright is a very important aspect of creating a digital products. Copyright laws protect IPs (Intellectual Properties) from being <br>
   
stolen, copied or used by someone it doesn’t belong to. An example of this can be a song. If someone were to make a song, they would have to claim <br>

it as their IP, so that it would be legally recognized as their creation and they could decide how and when other people are allowed to use it. Then <br>

if someone were to use that music in a movie for example without permission from the IP owner, they would be liable to a fine or even prosecution. <br>

This can work in your favour when creating an IP but also raises the problem of having to research any new ideas you come up with and making sure <br>

that they haven’t been used before and if they have, check with the owner what their policy is on using it. <br>
</p20></center><br>
<center><h20 class="large2">Unit 2, Outcome 1.6</h20></center><br>
<center><p21>When it comes to designing your User Interface, it’s very important to take into account the fact that many users may lack the ability <br>
   
to interact with a digital product the same way most people can. An example is someone with little to no eyesight. You need to design your UI in a <br>

way that’s compatible with users like this, so they can use your product. One way this can be done is by having a system which calls out the name of <br>

the object the user currently has their cursor on. This will allow them to paint a picture of the website and be able to use it, increasing your <br>

product’s accessibility. When it comes to reading text, you should try to incorporate a system that allows the user to read the contents in Braille. <br>
You should also consider adding a text version of visual elements to make your product more accessible to people who are hard of hearing. <br>
</p21></center><br>
<center><h21 class="large2">Unit 2, Outcome 1.7</h21></center><br>
<center><p22>There are multiple file types to consider when making a website as they are key for the program understanding what to do. The three <br>
   
most common, integral ones are HTML, which is mainly used for displaying text and calling objects from other sources. There’s also CSS, which is <br>

used for making your website more appealing and stylish, this is where images and other visual elements are stored which can then be used by the <br>

HTML file. Finally you have JavaScript, which is imperative for adding functionality and interactivity to your website, like adding buttons and <br>

hyperlinks as well as event driven scenarios.
