<h2 class="center large2"> About Me</h2>

<p2 class="center"> <div> I have a multitude of interests that vary from Astronomy, Game Design, Software Development and Content Creation. <div>

The important thing about these interests is that I lack the knowledge, skill, hardware and software to do them well. <div>

My plan to remedy this is to get an Apprenticeship in IT Maintenance so I can learn how to build a computer and understand <div>

what its specifications are and what they can do, as well as adding longevity to the systems I use. I also want to learn various <div>

coding languages so I could potentially make small game projects as a hobby as well as have the ability to make software and websites <div>

for any friends that might need them. After finishing a 13 week course with the Prince’s Trust, they recommended a coding course <div>

from CodeNation to me based on my interests they learned on the course. After completing the 1 week course, I’m currently on a <div>

3 week coding course with CodeNation so I can lay out the groundwork for progressing down the route I want to go down. <div>

While I’d failed to achieve what I’d hoped to, in a team project I contributed to the creation of a small text-based game which I consider <div>

to be a first draft of what I think I can make in the future. I’d managed to create an introduction to the game which gives some basic context <div>

into what the player is supposed to do and gives them the option of how to progress. This is the function I used to achieve this. <div>
