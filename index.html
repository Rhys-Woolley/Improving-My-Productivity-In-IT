<center><h2 class="large2"> About Me</h2></center>

<center><p2> I have a multitude of interests that vary from Astronomy, Game Design, Software Development and Content Creation. <br>

The important thing about these interests is that I lack the knowledge, skill, hardware and software to do them well. <br>

My plan to remedy this is to get an Apprenticeship in IT Maintenance so I can learn how to build a computer and understand <br>

what its specifications are and what they can do, as well as adding longevity to the systems I use. I also want to learn various <br>

coding languages so I could potentially make small game projects as a hobby as well as have the ability to make software and websites <br>

for any friends that might need them. After finishing a 13 week course with the Prince’s Trust, they recommended a coding course <br>

from CodeNation to me based on my interests they learned on the course. After completing the 1 week course, I’m currently on a <br>

3 week coding course with CodeNation so I can lay out the groundwork for progressing down the route I want to go down. <br>

While I’d failed to achieve what I’d hoped to, in a team project I contributed to the creation of a small text-based game which I consider <br>

to be a first draft of what I think I can make in the future. I’d managed to create an introduction to the game which gives some basic context <br>

into what the player is supposed to do and gives them the option of how to progress. This is the function I used to achieve this: <br> 
#def intro(): <br>

   # print("You are aboard a government loaned ship orbiting Titan, one of Saturn's moons") <br> 

   # time.sleep(4) <br>

   # print("Your mission is to board a research station on Titan and collect hard drives of data from the station.") <br>

   # time.sleep(5) <br>

   # print("Something has happened to the researchers there.") <br>

   # time.sleep(4) <br>

   # print("You stand at a terminal where you can contact the contractor for this mission and request backup if needed") <br>

   # time.sleep(5) <br>

   # doit = input("Do you want to explore the ship or continue the mission alone? [1] [2]> ") <br>

     

    #if doit == "1": <br>

   #     explore_ship() <br>

     

  #  elif doit == "2": <br>

 #       solo_explorer() <br>

#intro() <br></center>

<center><h3 class="large2">IT's Modern Uses</h3></center>

<center><p3>IT has many uses in modern business, it increases/improves productivity in multiple ways, like the ability to work <br>

from home in some instances, meaning that if for whatever reason an employee cannot come to work, like being ill or a sudden <br>

restriction to travel, their productivity would not be reduced. IT can also increase productivity in relation to the storage <br>

and handling of data, meaning instead of writing things down manually, users can store much more information on a server or hard drive <br>

than they could a physical piece of paper. This has revolutionized the way we achieve Networking and Digital Marketing, <br>

which has drastically improved productivity and thus, the economy. </p3></center>

<center><h4 class="large2">The SDLC</h4></center>

<center><p4>Designing and building a Digital system requires some methodology to accomplish in the most efficient manner. <br>
    
The preferred method of creating digital systems is referred to as the System/Software Development Life Cycle, or the SDLC, and usually <br>

contains five or six steps that you must follow when working on a project. These are as follows: <br>
<br>
Requirments/Analysis - Before you begin your project you must research the requirements to complete it. This includes what the system will <br>

be used for, who it is for and additional details regarding. For example, if you were making a registration system for a hospital, <br>

you would need to understand what the problem is with the current system, what changes would be made? Is this registration system for <br>

customer appointments? Present staff?  Once you understand what the intended outcome of the project is, you need to do a feasibility study, <br>

is the project withinyour capacity to complete? Consider things like cost, deadlines, your workforce and resources like computers and software. <br>
<br>
Design – This is where you begin planning your project. Before you begin coding your website/database/program, you need to decide <br>

what it will look like in terms of User Interface (UI) and how the system will complete its intended task. To do this you can develop <br>

Pseudo code, which is the process of displaying the code you intend to use in a way that’s easy for humans to read. <br>
<br>
Implementation – Now you understand what system you’re going to make, how long it will take to do it and how you are going to do it <br>

you can begin creating the system and translating your pseudo code into the relevant code to the programming language you are using. <br>
<br>
Testing – Before you release your program to the end-user/customer you must first double check that all of the code you’ve designed <br>

works as intended and the program as a whole functions to the specifications detailed in the first stage. <br>
<br>
Deployment – After the program has been thoroughly tested for bugs you need to ensure that the program fits the user’s specifications. <br>

You can follow a process known as User Acceptance Testing, which is where the user will test the system to see if it fits the <br>

specifications they listed and provide feedback on the project before it is fully released. then you now need to plan the most <br>
effective way to deploy the system while minimising the disruption to the workflow. <br>
<br>
Maintenance – Even though the system has been completed and implemented the project is not yet officially over. This is the time <br>

for user feedback. Once they’ve had ample time to use the system in the way it was meant for they can then provide feedback on the <br>

way the system works and report bugs and shortcomings if they exist. In the event the system needs to be updated, the SDLC resets and <br>
the updates can be developed in the same way the system was developed to begin with. </p4></center>
<center><h4 class="large2">The Project Planning Process</h4></center> <br>

<center><p5>I will plan the creation of my website step by step using Trello which will guide me in completing the individual aspects <br>
    
of the website in an efficient manner. I will follow the SDLC in order to make use of the minimal time I have for the project. This will <br>
    
be the best way to avoid issues like bugs and having to constantly rearrange the contents of the webpage and thus, the code needed to make it. <br>

</p6></center>

<center><h6 class="large2">Hardware Limitations</h6></center>
<center><p7>Before I begin the creation of my website, I need to consider the factors which affect the suitability of specific <br>
    
programming languages. Certain programming languages don’t have the same capabilities when using certain Operating Systems, and <br>

also don’t all have the same abilities when it comes to web design. This means I have to plan out what I intend to do on my website, <br>

research the capabilities of different programming languages to see if they can do what I need and also research which Operating <br>

Systems those programming languages work with in order to be sure I won’t hit an impasse during my project and have to start from scratch. </p7></center>
